## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started with DDEV

This project is set up to run in a **DDEV** environment for local development. Follow the steps below to get started.

### 1. Install DDEV (if you don‚Äôt have it)

Check out the official [DDEV Installation Guide](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/).

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scshasha/fixaroo.git
cd fixaroo
```

---

### 3. Initialize DDEV Project
Run the following command to set up your Laravel project in DDEV:
```bash
ddev config --project-name=fixaroo --project-type=laravel --docroot=public --create-docroot
```

---

### 4. Start DDEV
```bash
ddev start
```

---

### 5. Install Dependencies
Once DDEV is running, install Laravel dependencies using Composer:
```bash
ddev composer install
```

---

### 6. Environment Setup
Copy the environment files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Generate your application key:

```bash
ddev exec php artisan key:generate
```

---

### 7. Database Migration
Run the migration to set up the database tables:

```bash
ddev exec php artisan migrate
```

---

### 8. Build Assets
Fixaroo uses Laravel Mix to compile and manage frontend assets like CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts. Follow these steps to build the assets:

Install Node.js Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required npm packages:
```bash
ddev npm install
```

Development Build
For a development build (unminified assets, faster compilation):
```bash
ddev npm run mix:dev
```

Extra commands (minified assets, live reload):
```bash
ddev npm run mix:prod
```
```bash
ddev npm run mix:watch
```

---

### 9. Clean Destination Folders Before Building
To ensure that old or unused files are removed before generating new assets, Laravel Mix is configured to clean the destination folders (public/themes/fixaroo-base) during the build process. This happens automatically when you run any of the above commands (mix:dev, mix:prod, or mix:watch).

If you'd like to manually verify the cleaning behavior, check the webpack.mix.js file for the configuration of the CleanWebpackPlugin.

---

### 10. Access the Application
Once everything is up and running, visit your Fixaroo site:

üëâ https://fixaroo.ddev.site

---

### 11. Optional: Seed the Database
If you have seeders, you can run:

```bash
ddev exec php artisan db:seed
```

---

### 12. Debugging Asset Builds
If you encounter issues while building assets, try the following:

Clear Laravel Cache:
```bash
ddev exec php artisan cache:clear
```
```bash
ddev exec php artisan config:clear
```
```bash
ddev exec php artisan view:clear
```
Reinstall Node Modules:
```bash
ddev npm install
```
Manually Run Mix Commands:
```bash
ddev npm run mix:dev
```
